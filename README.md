This boilerplate is built using [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) so you will want to read the User Guide for more goodies.
# gitusers

NOTES:
    - since the app is tiny, im using a single file for actions, reducers, constants
        ~/src/modules/users.js
    - for the 'public repos' & 'public_gists' section, made the assumption that this should just be the count
            *** this is obviously a point where Id seek calrification from UX, product owner, or the person that defines the 'acceptance criteria'
    - Assuming that all required fields in UX will be present in a '200' return because git requires them for registration and returns appropriate vals for each.
